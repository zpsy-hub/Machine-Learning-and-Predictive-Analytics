# Machine-Learning-and-Predictive-Analytics

COURSE DESCRIPTION

Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics is a 3-unit course that provides an overview of machine learning techniques and predictive analytics methodologies. In this course, learners will explore the entire machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and deployment. They will learn a variety of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms and techniques for regression, classification, clustering, and anomaly detection.


COURSE OUTCOMES

Preprocess data from sources, ensuring quality and consistency.
Apply statistical reasoning and data visualization techniques to identify trends, patterns, correlations, and anomalies within datasets.
Develop forecasts using appropriate modeling techniques to predict future values based on historical data.

TERMINAL ASSESSMENT AND MILESTONES

In groups, the learners will work on a project that analyzes and resolves an issue encountered by FinMark Corporation using machine learning and predictive analytics. The terminal assessment nurtures the learners' technical, analytical, and presentation skills, vital for fostering proficiency in machine learning and predictive analytics. The learners are prepared to complete this output through the following milestones:

- Milestone 1: Project Predictive Model -  a machine learning model to predict a customer's purchasing likelihood using the provided datasets.
- Milestone 2: Project Forecasting Model with Visualizations - a machine learning model that forecasts the FinMark Corporation sales using historical data.
- Terminal Assessment: Project Presentation - a presentation of the course project created, data analysis performed, and the results obtained.
